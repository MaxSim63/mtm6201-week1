                Hello! I am Maxim Simonov, a student, entrepreneur, and thrill seeker. I currently work at a restaurant
                downtown on my off days/time. I enjoy playing video games and hanging out with friends, as well as
                playing sports.
            </p>

            <p>
                My 19th birthday has yet to pass, but I aspire to be rich by 20. My personal definition of being rich is
                financial freedom and to live life to the fullest stress free. My parents both came from Belarus thus
                making me 100% Belarusian although I was born in Canada. I have no siblings, but I have a black cat
                named Nox. The name translates from the Latin word <em>"night."</em>.
            </p>
